# Selenium
I have executed the basic to advanced concepts of Selenium : 
- Installing and configuring the Selenium WebDriver and browser drivers.
- Using different strategies to find elements on a web page (ID, Name, Class Name, Tag Name, Link Text, Partial Link Text, CSS Selector, XPath).
- Implementing implicit and explicit waits to handle dynamic content.
- Navigating to web pages, locating web elements, and performing actions like clicking, typing, etc.
- Interacting with elements like dropdowns, checkboxes, radio buttons, and alerts.
- Using Actions class for complex interactions (mouse hover, drag and drop).
